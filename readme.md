# Frontend task

> Create a signup form that feels great to use, based on a few simple sketches!

We've created a simple sketch for you to develop in the web technologies of your choice. The focus in this task is on smooth user inputs, transitions, animations, and any other attributes of a great user experience on the frontend.

## Requirements
The only hard requirements are:
* Implement the signup form to resemble the sketches as closely as possible
* The user has to be able to interact with and complete the form
* The delivery should be possible to view or run on another developer's computer.

## Resources
* [Sketches](/sketches)
* [Simple Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/PnmEXK64A0iI8rCnQgIgq4/Frontend-task?node-id=1%3A23&viewport=785%2C336%2C0.22817742824554443&scaling=min-zoom)

## Practical
This is just a demo task, so feel free to do what you want, and work until you have something you want to show us :)

_Disclaimer: This task isn't related to Teston at all. We will only use it to evaluate your work and get to know a little bit about your style!_

#### Tips
A few tips on getting started from us:

* Clone this repo and start working locally in the [delivery](/delivery) folder
* Time-box your work as much as you can
* Focus on what you think is important
* The data in the form doesn't have to be sent anywhere
* Remember that you'll get a chance to present your work and explain your decisions :)

#### Evaluation
When evaluating your work, we will be looking at a combination of styling, interaction and logic, but in this task we'll focus the most on the styling and interaction aspects. For instance, a good CSS and HTML structure may be weighed more than great input validation.  

#### Delivery
Share the work with us (e.g. by pushing the work to a new repo and adding `semonje` as a collaborator, sending it on e-mail, etc).

#### Questions
If you have any questions about the assignment or about Teston, please send a mail to simon.dagfinrud@teston.io, who will try to answer you as soon as possible!
